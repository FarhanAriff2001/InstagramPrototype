# InstagramPrototype

Developed a simplified Instagram clone with a React frontend and a Flask (Python) REST API backend. Implemented core social media features including user authentication, post creation, and commenting. Designed and exposed backend APIs using Flask to handle data flow between the client and server, enabling clean separation of concerns and maintainable frontend-backend integration.
